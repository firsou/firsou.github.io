Arduino Smartcar is an embedded system written for Arduino coupled with an Android Application.
It is a fully automated miniature vehicle that also comprises manual driving modes using several input methods: joystick, D-PAD and tilt controls.

### App

Written in the Java, the app first uses the Bluetooth interface of your Android phone to connect to the car. You are then greeted by a home screen comprised of a default control method (joystick), a radar, an Autonomous Mode switch as well as a button leading to the Settings window.
